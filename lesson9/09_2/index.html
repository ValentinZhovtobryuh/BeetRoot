                <p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I
                    watched
                    C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like
                    tears in rain... <em>Time to die.</em>
                </p><br>

                <p>I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had
                    before. Not just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...
